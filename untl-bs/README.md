This study sought to assess what areas of the UNTL-BS schema (as it stood in 2022) would benefit most from having additional terms added to them, and what new terms might benefit the schema the most. All files related to this project may be found in the "untl-bs" folder of the UNTL GitHub repository. The data was generated and exported using Solr queries of the index to the Portal to Texas History, and further manipulated in Excel.

"Code" contains the various Python scripts used to generate the datasets found in "data."

"Data" is by far the largest folder, and contains multiple sub-folders corresponding to the various stages of the study.

1. Preliminary Examinations - this folder contains some of Hannah J.'s first examinations of the UNTL-BS data.
 - "BranchPercentages" displays the total usage of the UNTL-BS schema on the Portal as a pie chart, divided into the schema's 14 main branches.
 - The two "OccurrenceRates" documents as well as the "FrequencyOfOccurrenceCounts" document compare the occurrence rates of the UNTL-BS terms against those in the custom keyword field.
 - The "collocations" folder contains data related to the Collocation Rates analysis, which captures the strength of associations between UNTL-BS terms and other subject terms on the Portal's records

2. Outlier Analysis - this folder contains two documents, both related to
