Cliff Home	"The Cliff Home\, an early Mineral Wells hotel\, stood on Northeast 2nd Street (formerly Coke Street) just east of the head of NE 1st Avenue (formerly Mesquite Street)\, and the site of the 1912 ""Old Post Office"" (now the Women's Club.)\n     The hotel burned down in 1899\, and the Plateau Hotel was built in its place.

Mexican Revolutionist	"Photograph of a Mexican Revolutionist.  There is no accompanying information about who this individual is or where this photograph was taken.

Since Otis Aultman photographed most of his pictures along the U.S. Mexican border - mostly in El Paso and Ciudad Juarez. A strong argument could be made that this individual was most likely a Maderista and that this photograph was taken somewhere within Ciudad Juarez.  Francisco Madero\, at one time\, had his headquarters near Smeltertown in El Paso\, Texas.   The Maderista was a name given to the revolutionary army united by Francisco Madero."

[The Mineral Wells Mounted Police]	"A copy of a newspaper clipping\, the caption identifies members of the Mineral Wells Mounted Police ""57 years ago.""  Identified are: ""Uncle Billy Wood"" on his white horse (not a member of the force); Bob Pate; Paul Craig; Jim Barrett\, probably Chief of Police at the time; Paul Granbury.  All are reported to be deceased at time of printing.  \n     The picture was furnished to the paper courtesy Mrs. Paul Granbury.  The sign on the building at the far left of the picture has been tentatively identified as a Livery Stable.  Though the sign is visible\, the distance has made its contents extremely obscure.                                          The first city hall was located at the corner of First Avenue and Third Street\, with a fence to hold impounded livestock.  The rounding up of stray livestock was the primary duty of the mounted police in 1910.  Two more more individuals were also forbidden to fight in public; no-one was permitted to use obscene language; playing cards for liquor.  The renting of houses for the playing of cards was also forbidden.  Teams were not allowed to be unhitched while attached to wagons\, and vagrants were fined $10- In short\, the police team were kept busy.  These details are taken from ""The Mineral wells Police Department 1882-1988"" by Kaye Ashby\, in the custody of the Boyce Ditto Library."
