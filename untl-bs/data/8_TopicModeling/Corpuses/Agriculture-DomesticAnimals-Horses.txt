Also not known is the name of the National Guardsmen Unit or Units that are represented here in this photographic event.  We also do not have information from where these National Guardsmen are coning from.  The word 'hike' meant that these troops were moving from one temporary camp location to another temporary camp location.  Troops remained in these temporary camps; usually just overnight but no more than a few days; and this allowed the troops and their horses and mules a chance to rest.  Visible in this photograph are the National Guardsmen Troops; horses; tents; supplies; supply wagons; and an unknown mountain range in the background.	National Guardsmen	National guard troops	W.H.

ark:/67531/metapth20315	Cliff Home	The Cliff Home, an early Mineral Wells hotel, stood on Northeast 2nd Street (formerly Coke Street) just east of the head of NE 1st Avenue (formerly Mesquite Street), and the site of the 1912 "Old Post Office" (now the Women's Club.)
     The hotel burned down in 1899, and the Plateau Hotel was built in its place.  That hotel, in time, became The Exchange Hotel, which lasted until 1900, at which time it was demolished, and the Plateau Hotel was built in its place.  It was touted as the only brick hotel in Mineral Wells in 1902.  The Sanborn Map of 1907 gives the address as "207 E Coke", but the city Directory of 1909 lists the hotel as being at "211 E Coke."  No building was listed in the City Directory in that block for the year 1920, save the Post Office.                                                                                                       
     A street was added to the east of the Post Office between it and the Hotel Wilson(of which no further information at this time [2017] is available)/Mineral Wells Sanitarium (the building must have housed a hospital/clinic, as well), which was operated by a Doctor Buie.  In 1924, the hotel was listed as being at 209 NE 2nd Street, and the sanitarium at 211 NE 2nd street.  No listing for the sanitarium is given in the 1937 City Directory.   
     The significance of the small "E" between "CLIFF" and "HOME" on the sign painted on the roof is not as yet [2017] known.  
     The back of the photograph bears the name "Henry Sikes" (a banker in Graford, and probably the donor of the picture) written in ink, and a business stamp, "S.B. Hall, General Photographer." 
    This picture is found on page 100 of A.F. Weaver's book "TIME WAS In Mineral Wells".

While trying to secure her belongings and escape the home of Mr. Heyser, the general manager of Tellico Lumber, Belle fell into the water beneath a rearing horse ("Joe the horse"). She was saved by John Ballon, a black preacher, whom she called her "hero." Belle mentions that she plans to join Ballon's church and send him a poem entitled "John Ballon and the Flood of '98."

ark:/67531/metapth25103	[Blind Nellie]	Blind Nellie was brought to Mineral Wells by a cowboy, who sold her at auction for a dollar and a half.  She eventually came into the possession of Colonel W.R. Austin, who used her to turn the wheel of the pump at the Austin Well.  The horse became a tourist attraction in that capacity.  When she was retired, she continued to walk in circles in her pasture.  She was given a ceremonial burial when she died in 1912, a burial attended by a large crowd of admirers.  The story may be found on page 54 of "TIME WAS in Mineral Wells..." by A.F. Weaver.  
     Written on the back of this photograph is  "Blind Nellie at Austin Well located in the 900 block of N.E. 2nd Ave."  This is clearly a photograph of a newspaper clipping.	Austin Well	Mineral Wells

ark:/67531/metapth38082	[The Mineral Wells Mounted Police]	A copy of a newspaper clipping, the caption identifies members of the Mineral Wells Mounted Police "57 years ago."  Identified are: "Uncle Billy Wood" on his white horse (not a member of the force); Bob Pate; Paul Craig; Jim Barrett, probably Chief of Police at the time; Paul Granbury.  All are reported to be deceased at time of printing.  
     The picture was furnished to the paper courtesy Mrs. Paul Granbury.  The sign on the building at the far left of the picture has been tentatively identified as a Livery Stable.  Though the sign is visible, the distance has made its contents extremely obscure.                                          The first city hall was located at the corner of First Avenue and Third Street, with a fence to hold impounded livestock.  The rounding up of stray livestock was the primary duty of the mounted police in 1910.  Two more more individuals were also forbidden to fight in public; no-one was permitted to use obscene language; playing cards for liquor.  The renting of houses for the playing of cards was also forbidden.  Teams were not allowed to be unhitched while attached to wagons, and vagrants were fined $10- In short, the police team were kept busy.  These details are taken from "The Mineral wells Police Department 1882-1988" by Kaye Ashby, in the custody of the Boyce Ditto Library.	Barrett, Jim	Craig, Paul	Granbury, Paul	Pate, Bob	Wood, Billy

ark:/67531/metapth63271	Mexican Revolutionist	Photograph of a Mexican Revolutionist.  There is no accompanying information about who this individual is or where this photograph was taken.  One point that can be made about this photograph is that this revolutionist is outfitted in the typical style that both the Zapatistas and the Maderistas wore.  Since Otis Aultman photographed most of his pictures along the U.S. Mexican border - mostly in El Paso and Ciudad Juarez. A strong argument could be made that this individual was most likely a Maderista and that this photograph was taken somewhere within Ciudad Juarez.  Francisco Madero, at one time, had his headquarters near Smeltertown in El Paso, Texas.   The Maderista was a name given to the revolutionary army united by Francisco Madero.

In the bottom photograph, the winning horse, Zipolo Honey, and his jockey stand beside the horse's owner Santos Jaramillo along with the horse trainers, Pancho Garza and Pete de Luna.  In 1937, Santos Jaramillo started Jaramillo Cattle hauling with a bob-tailed truck.  He soon had a fleet of big cattle trailers, taking cattle to market from ranches all over South Texas, and even by ferry from St. Joseph Island.  After WWII, the railroad’s agricultural customers began to see the advantages of shipping by truck.  While shipping by rail was less expensive, trucking was faster.  Without the regulations of having to stop to feed and water the cattle, the truckers took cattle from the ranch to market in half the time.	Railroad	Viva Downs	jockeys	Bee County (Tex.)
