North, Jr., editor of the Fort Worth Star-Telegram and Vice-President of Carter Publications.  North raised herefords and showhorses.  The extensive farm was split by the construction of I-35.  The stone barn was built by Eugene Sergi, an Italian immigrant who set up a stone and cement contracting business in Ft. Worth after WWI, known as Roma Stone Co.  Construction is rubblestone and shellstone, with dressed sandstone quoins at each corner.  The barn was renovated later to house the Woodbine Corporation offices, then later sold to the Springcreek Barbeque owners to renovate and open as a restaraunt in the mid-1990s by the name Shady Oak Barbeque.

ark:/67531/metapth78691	Cattle Round Up On the Brown Ranch	Photograph of cowboys herding cattle on the Ed Brown Ranch. The Brown family has been in Bee County for several generations. Austin II's great grandfather operated the mercantile store on the square in town. Austin I, his son, was in the bulk fuel business. As a wholesale dealer for Magnolia, which later became Mobil, he delivered kerosene and gasoline to farm families with a wagon and team.  Every time he made a dollar or two, Austin Brown I bought a little piece of land. He began putting the ranch together in 1924.  The headquarters operation, where their preconditioning facility is located, is in Bee County, but they lease several other ranches in South Texas.
Early on, like many South Texans, the Browns ran Brahman cattle. In 1945, Ed bought some registered Hereford cattle from a man in the area. He began crossing these Herefords with the Brahman cattle and ended up with a "tiger stripe-looking animal," Austin says. "My grandfather found out right quick that the first cross (F-1) was one of the best animals ever developed for Texas."  Eventually the Browns phased out the Brahman cattle altogether and began building their Hereford program. Today they continue to maintain a base herd of 200 registered Hereford cows.

ark:/67531/metapth78859	Cotton Gin and Stock Pens in Skidmore	Two photographs taken in Skidmore, Texas. These two pictures of a cotton gin and stock pens represent two important economical activities in early Skidmore. In the early part of the 1900’s, Charles Blaschke and Joe Beyer built a cotton gin near the old overpass.  The cotton was carried by hand in baskets from the ginstand up to the press to be made into bales.  This gin was sold and later burned.  T.C. Buerger built a gin on the Blaschke property in the residential section of Skidmore. Charles Blaschke bought a partnership in the gin.  The gin was eventually closed and moved to Olmos where J.S. Hall of Beeville rebuilt it.  
Thomas R. Atkins, who came to Beeville in 1860, wrote that there were vast herds of Longhorn cattle and thousands of Spanish horses roaming through the tall grass.  These cattle and horses were here because of early Spanish ranches in South Texas. Stock raising began in Skidmore about 1840, when cattle were brought from Gonzales and Austin.  Mr.Skidmore brought the first registered Hereford cattle to the area in the 1870’s.  One rancher settled in the bend of the Aransas Creek with a herd of almost eight hundred cattle.  At that time, there were no timber or brush obstructions.  Since there were no fences until the late 1800’s, the stockman ranged his cattle on this vast expanse of prairie land, employing riders to keep his cattle from straying.  Frank O. Skidmore gained statewide attention with his barbed wire fence in 1877.  The invention of the windmill helped grazing beyond natural water sources.  By 1895 this area was virtually a windmill forest.  A number of early ranchers took part in the old cattle drives to points north, including Kansas. The original Chisholm Trail was surveyed north of the Red River, but feeder lines of the trail passed through this area in South Texas.  Many of the cattle that traveled the Chisholm Trail started that drive from this southern tip of Bee County.  The building of the railroad in 1886 was one of the greatest history-making events that occurred in Skidmore’s history.  Cattle could now be taken to market by rail.
